# -- chat.yml
# Default format file for global chat
# Keep in mind: These are all examples
#  For instance: You don't have to use PlaceholderAPI for anything
#
# Some placeholders will be parsed even if PlaceholderAPI is not loaded:
# %player_name% - The players username
# %message% - The sent chat message
#
# A format is divided in parts, which you can configure individually
# Parts will simply be appended to each other (with different actions/hover text of course!)
parts:

  # You can give a part any name, not just numbers
  # You could add descriptive names, or just numbers
  # They are ordered by the order in this file
  1:

    # This is simply the text you will see in the chat
    # The default configuration uses a PlaceholderAPI placeholder for the Vault prefix
    text: '&9%vault_prefix%'

    # The text you will see when your mouse is over the text
    # You can either make this a list of strings or a single string (see part 2)
    # If you set this to '' or leave it out completely, no hover text will appear
    hover:
      - '&9Rank: &f%vault_rank%'
      - ''
      - '&9Buy this rank at &bstore.example.com&9!'

    # This is what you want to happen when you click this part of the format
    click:

      # Choose from OPEN_FILE, OPEN_URL, RUN_COMMAND and SUGGEST_COMMAND
      # It's pretty self-explanatory what they do
      type: 'RUN_COMMAND'

      # The text to go with the type
      # For instance, for RUN_COMMAND, the command you want the player to run
      # Don't forget the '/' at the start!
      text: '/buy'

    # The target for all the placeholders in this part
    # You can leave this empty or out if you don't use PlaceholderAPI
    # Choose from SENDER and RECEIVER   # TODO note to self: It's not really applicable in this situation, maybe move this line to private messages
    placeholder-target: 'SENDER'

  2:

    # Placeholders like %player_name% will be parsed even if PlaceholderAPI is not loaded (see top)
    text: '&f%player_name%'

    # An example of a one-line hover message
    hover: '&9Nickname: &f%player_displayname%'

    click:
      type: 'SUGGEST_COMMAND'

      # You can even use placeholders in places you don't expect!
      text: '/pm %player_name%'

  3:
    text: '&f: %message%'

    # Anything you don't need, you can just leave out
